### Dependencies and Environment Setup

This part of the documentation will list all the dependencies and libraries required to run the project and provide instructions on how to set up the development environment. Since I've already analyzed the repository, I can provide this information:

#### Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:
- **WebGPU**: For rendering the bar graph using GPU acceleration.
- **SQLite**: For storing and retrieving the user-generated data.
- **Express**: A web application framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware to handle JSON requests in Express.

#### Environment Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Fayaz-khani/WebGPU_Hack).
2. **Install Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required Node.js packages.
4. **Start the Server**: Run `node server.js` to start the Express server.
5. **Open the Interface**: Open the `index.html` file in a browser that supports WebGPU (e.g., Google Chrome Canary).

#### Specific Versions or Configurations
- **WebGPU**: Ensure that the browser used supports the WebGPU API. Google Chrome Canary with the appropriate flags enabled is recommended.
- **SQLite**: The project uses SQLite version 3.x.
