### User Interface (UI)

The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to input data and visualize the results. Here's how to access and interact with it:

1. **Open the Interface**: Navigate to the `index.html` file in the project directory and open it in a browser that supports WebGPU (e.g., Google Chrome Canary).
2. **Input Data**: Users can input two types of data: a string (e.g., "January") and an integer (e.g., 400). This data represents the categories and values to be visualized in the bar graph.
3. **Render Graph**: After entering the data, click the "Render" button to generate the bar graph. The graph will be displayed below the input fields.
4. **Interact with the Graph**: Users can hover over the bars in the graph to see the exact values.

#### Demo Video
A demo video showcasing the UI's features and functionality is available in the project repository under the path `Demo\Demo.mkv`. You can view the video to see the interface in action.
