### Training and Evaluation

This project does not involve the training of AI models or the evaluation of their performance. Instead, it focuses on rendering a bar graph based on user-generated data.

#### Processing User Input
The user provides two types of data: a string (e.g., "January") and an integer (e.g., 400). The project takes this input and processes it to create vertices for rendering the bar graph.

#### Rendering the Graph
The processed vertices are then used to render the bar graph using WebGPU. The rendering process includes the following steps:
1. **Preparing the Vertices**: The vertices are prepared based on the user input, defining the shape and size of the bars in the graph.
2. **Creating the Vertex Buffer**: A GPU buffer is created to store the vertices.
3. **Creating the Render Pipeline**: The render pipeline is defined, including the shaders and other configurations.
4. **Drawing the Graph**: The graph is drawn on the canvas using the prepared vertices, vertex buffer, and render pipeline.

Here's a code snippet illustrating the rendering process:

```javascript
function renderBarGraph(salesData) {
  const vertices = prepareBarVertices(salesData);
  const vertexBuffer = createVertexBuffer(vertices);
  const pipeline = createPipeline(vertexShaderCode, fragmentShaderCode);

  const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder();
  const passEncoder = commandEncoder.beginRenderPass({
    colorAttachments: [{
      view: context.getCurrentTexture().createView(),
      loadValue: { r: 1, g: 1, b: 1, a: 1 },
      loadOp: 'load',
      storeOp: 'store',
    }],
  });

  passEncoder.setPipeline(pipeline);
  passEncoder.setVertexBuffer(0, vertexBuffer);
  passEncoder.draw(6 * salesData.length, 1, 0, 0);
  passEncoder.finish();
  device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]);
}
```

This code snippet illustrates how the user-generated data is processed and rendered as a bar graph on the canvas.
