### Results and Analysis

#### Visual Output
The primary result of this project is the visual representation of user-generated data in the form of a bar graph. The graph is rendered on a canvas using WebGPU, providing a clear and concise visualization of the data. The user can input different data sets, such as sales figures or English proficiency by country, and the graph will dynamically update to reflect the new data.

#### Challenges and Solutions
During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and addressed:

1. **WebGPU Integration**: Integrating WebGPU for rendering required careful configuration and understanding of the new API. Solutions were found through extensive research and testing.
2. **Data Processing**: Converting user input into a format suitable for rendering required careful consideration of data types and structures. The code was refined to handle various input formats effectively.
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring that the rendering worked across different browsers required adjustments to the code and thorough testing.

#### Visualizations
Screenshots or a demo video can be included here to showcase the rendered bar graph and any UI features.
